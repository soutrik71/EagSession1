In cooperation with strategic battery manufacturing partners, we\u2019re planning to build a large scale factory that will allow us to achieve economies of scale and minimize costs through innovative manufacturing, reduction of logistics waste, optimization of co-located processes and reduced overhead. The Gigafactory is designed to reduce cell costs much faster than the status quo and, by 2020, produce more lithium ion batteries annually than were produced worldwide in 2013. By the end of the first year of volume production of our mass market vehicle, we expect the Gigafactory will have driven down the per kWh cost of our battery pack by more than 30 percent.

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. [1] The company notes that \u2018the commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers\u2019 range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles\u2019. [2] Tesla Motors makes much of its inventive labour force: \u2018Our roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and 1 Tesla Motors, \u2018Annual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012\u2019, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 2 Ibid. 2 software engineering\u2019. [3] The company observes: \u2018We believe these capabilities, coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong in-house engineering and manufacturing capacity, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the Tesla Roadster and Model S.\u2019 [4] The chief executive officer and product architect of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk has established a reputation for being an innovative entrepreneur, across a range of technological fields, including information technology, clean technology, electric cars, and spacecraft. His Tesla Motors\u2019 biography gives a sense of this diverse array of interests: At Tesla, Elon has overseen product development and design from the beginning, including the all electric Tesla Roadster, Model S and Model X. Transitioning to a sustainable energy economy, in which electric vehicles play a pivotal role, has been one of his central interests for almost two decades, stemming from his time as a physics student working on ultracapacitors in Silicon Valley. At SpaceX, Elon is the chief designer, overseeing development of rockets\",\n      \"source\": \"Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf\",\n      \"chunk_id\": \"Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_0\",\n      \"score\": 0.9653496742248535\n    },\n    {\n      \"chunk\": \"42 **A.** **Sustainable Transportation** The decision to open source electric cars was praised by environmental leaders \u2014 such as the Sierra Club and the Climate Council in Australia. Jeff Tittel of the New Jersey Sierra Club has maintained: \u2018We need zero-emission vehicles, which means we also need to educate consumers and inform them about the benefits of owning an electric car.\u2019 [168] Mark Ruffalo \u2014 the actor famous for playing the Incredible Hulk in the Avengers \u2014 was also admiring of Elon Musk\u2019s elan, commenting: \u2018Bravo Elon Musk you are a real super hero! So proud to know you. Such a cool thing to do!\u2019 [169] In its 2014 report upon mitigation, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change devoted a chapter to the topic of Transportation. [170] The executive summary noted that \u2018Reducing global transport greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will be challenging since the continuing growth in passenger and freight activity could outweigh all mitigation measures unless transport emissions can be strongly decoupled from GDP growth.\u2019 [171] The report warned: \u2018Without aggressive and sustained mitigation policies being implemented, transport emissions could increase at a faster rate than emissions from the other energy end\u2010use sector and reach around 2014, http://report.mitigation2014.org/drafts/final - draft postplenary/ipcc _ wg3 _ ar5 _ final - draft _ postplenary _ chapter8.pdf 171 Ibid. 43 12 Gt CO2eq/yr by 2050.\u2019 [172] The report recommended: \u2018Avoided journeys and modal shifts due to behavioural change, uptake of improved vehicle and engine performance technologies, low\u2010carbon fuels, investments in related infrastructure, and changes in the built environment, together offer high mitigation potential (high confidence).\u2019 [173] Amongst other things, the report considered the use of electric vehicles. President Barack Obama has been keen to make electric cars more affordable and accessible to the American public. [174] In his 2011 State of the Union address, he observed: \u2018With more research and incentives, we can break our dependence on oil with biofuels, and become the first country to have a million electric vehicles on the road by 2015.\u2019 [175] He has sought to encourage United States innovators and entrepreneurs in the field of clean technology. Tesla has been supported by the United States Government through a US. Energy Department Vehicle Loan. Tesla was able to repay the loan to the government in 2013.

Jason Perlow wrote an incisive piece entitled, \u2018Why Detroit will Squander Tesla\u2019s Patent Present.\u2019 [137] He suggested: \u2018I suspect that one of the reasons behind Elon Musk\u2019s open source motivations is that he is looking for large partners to finance and build the many \u201cgigafactories\u201d needed to mass-produce the batteries at scale, which is the single largest component cost of his cars, and the patent portfolio of Tesla is the \u201ccarrot.\u201d\u2019 [138] Perlow wondered whether traditional manufacturers would invest in electric cars: \u2018In order for the Big Three and the rest to make that leap, even with the patents, they will need to make substantial investments, on the order of many billions of dollars.\u2019 [139] He observed that there were longstanding relationships between the automobile manufacturers and the oil industry. Perlow concluded: \u2018Unless our world governments step in and give them huge incentives to do otherwise, I don\u2019t see the big auto manufacturers taking advantage of Musk\u2019s gifts and breaking up a century-old romance with Big Oil.\u2019 [140] 136 Ibid. 137 Jason Perlow, \u2018Why Detroit Will Squander Tesla\u2019s Patent Present\u2019, ZDNet, 17 June 2014, http://www.zdnet.com/why - detroit - will - squander - teslas - patent - present - 7000030497/ 138 Ibid. 139 Ibid. 140 Ibid. 35 James Bessen, an economist from the Boston University School of Law, provided a thoughtful historical analysis of Tesla\u2019s patent-sharing in the *Harvard Business Review* . [141] He suggested that \u2018the conditions that make knowledge sharing advantageous today won\u2019t last forever.\u2019 [142] Bessen predicted: \u2018Eventually electric vehicles will replace much of the market for gasoline-powered cars.\u2019 He observed that at that stage, \u2018competition from other electric vehicle makers will affect Tesla\u2019s profits and such extensive sharing might no longer be beneficial.\u2019 [143] **4.** **Trade Mark Law, Branding, and Marketing** **Image:** [Image: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf-35-0.png] 141 James Bessen, \u2018History Backs up Tesla\u2019s Patent-Sharing\u2019, *Harvard Business Review*, 13 June 2014, http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/06/history - backs - up - teslas - patent - sharing/ 142 Ibid. 143 Ibid. 36 There has sometimes been concern about the failure of the clean technology industry to engage in marketing. In its annual report, Tesla Motors highlights the role of marketing in respect of electric cars. The company notes: \u2018As the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant, fully electric vehicle that achieves market-leading range on a single charge, we have been able to generate significant media coverage of our company and our vehicles, and we believe we will continue to do so\u2019.

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. [1] The company notes that \u2018the commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers\u2019 range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles\u2019. [2] Tesla Motors makes much of its inventive labour force: \u2018Our roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and 1 Tesla Motors, \u2018Annual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012\u2019, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 2 Ibid. 2 software engineering\u2019. [3] The company observes: \u2018We believe these capabilities, coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong in-house engineering and manufacturing capacity, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the Tesla Roadster and Model S.\u2019 [4] The chief executive officer and product architect of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk has established a reputation for being an innovative entrepreneur, across a range of technological fields, including information technology, clean technology, electric cars, and spacecraft. His Tesla Motors\u2019 biography gives a sense of this diverse array of interests: At Tesla, Elon has overseen product development and design from the beginning, including the all electric Tesla Roadster, Model S and Model X. Transitioning to a sustainable energy economy, in which electric vehicles play a pivotal role, has been one of his central interests for almost two decades, stemming from his time as a physics student working on ultracapacitors in Silicon Valley. At SpaceX, Elon is the chief designer, overseeing development of rockets\",\n      \"source\": \"Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf\",\n      \"chunk_id\": \"Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_0\",\n      \"score\": 1.01896333694458\n    }\n  ],\n  \"total_results\": 5,\n  \"query\": \"Tesla carbon emission strategies\",\n  \"success\": true,\n  \"error_message\": \"Search completed successfully.

In 2012, the company observed: \u2018Our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties.\u2019 [8] Tesla Motors warned: Any failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology.

Perlow concluded: \u2018Unless our world governments step in and give them huge incentives to do otherwise, I don\u2019t see the big auto manufacturers taking advantage of Musk\u2019s gifts and breaking up a century-old romance with Big Oil.\u2019 [140] 136 Ibid. 137 Jason Perlow, \u2018Why Detroit Will Squander Tesla\u2019s Patent Present\u2019, ZDNet, 17 June 2014, http://www.zdnet.com/why - detroit - will - squander - teslas - patent - present - 7000030497/ 138 Ibid. 139 Ibid. 140 Ibid. 35 James Bessen, an economist from the Boston University School of Law, provided a thoughtful historical analysis of Tesla\u2019s patent-sharing in the *Harvard Business Review* .

As part of his agenda to act on climate change, President Barack Obama has been keen to promote United States innovation in respect of clean technologies \u2014 such as electric vehicles and other advanced green automobiles. On the 14th June 2014, President Barack Obama gave a commencement address to the University of California, Irvine. He told his audience: We need scientists to design new fuels. We need farmers to help grow them. We need engineers to invent new technologies. We need entrepreneurs to sell those technologies. We need workers to operate assembly lines that hum with high-tech, zero-carbon components. We need builders to hammer into place the foundations for a clean energy age. We need diplomats and businessmen and women, and Peace Corps volunteers to help developing nations skip past the dirty phase of development and transition to sustainable sources of energy.

In cooperation with strategic battery manufacturing partners, we\u2019re planning to build a large scale factory that will allow us to achieve economies of scale and minimize costs through innovative manufacturing, reduction of logistics waste, optimization of co-located processes and reduced overhead. The Gigafactory is designed to reduce cell costs much faster than the status quo and, by 2020, produce more lithium ion batteries annually than were produced worldwide in 2013. By the end of the first year of volume production of our mass market vehicle, we expect the Gigafactory will have driven down the per kWh cost of our battery pack by more than 30 percent.

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. [1] The company notes that \u2018the commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers\u2019 range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles\u2019. [2] Tesla Motors makes much of its inventive labour force: \u2018Our roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and 1 Tesla Motors, \u2018Annual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012\u2019, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 2 Ibid. 2 software engineering\u2019. [3] The company observes: \u2018We believe these capabilities, coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong in-house engineering and manufacturing capacity, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the Tesla Roadster and Model S.\u2019 [4] The chief executive officer and product architect of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk has established a reputation for being an innovative entrepreneur, across a range of technological fields, including information technology, clean technology, electric cars, and spacecraft. His Tesla Motors\u2019 biography gives a sense of this diverse array of interests: At Tesla, Elon has overseen product development and design from the beginning, including the all electric Tesla Roadster, Model S and Model X. Transitioning to a sustainable energy economy, in which electric vehicles play a pivotal role, has been one of his central interests for almost two decades, stemming from his time as a physics student working on ultracapacitors in Silicon Valley. At SpaceX, Elon is the chief designer, overseeing development of rockets\",\n      \"source\": \"Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf\",\n      \"chunk_id\": \"Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_0\",\n      \"score\": 0.8972169756889343\n    },\n    {\n      \"chunk\": \"42 **A.** **Sustainable Transportation** The decision to open source electric cars was praised by environmental leaders \u2014 such as the Sierra Club and the Climate Council in Australia. Jeff Tittel of the New Jersey Sierra Club has maintained: \u2018We need zero-emission vehicles, which means we also need to educate consumers and inform them about the benefits of owning an electric car.\u2019 [168] Mark Ruffalo \u2014 the actor famous for playing the Incredible Hulk in the Avengers \u2014 was also admiring of Elon Musk\u2019s elan, commenting: \u2018Bravo Elon Musk you are a real super hero! So proud to know you. Such a cool thing to do!\u2019 [169] In its 2014 report upon mitigation, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change devoted a chapter to the topic of Transportation. [170] The executive summary noted that \u2018Reducing global transport greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will be challenging since the continuing growth in passenger and freight activity could outweigh all mitigation measures unless transport emissions can be strongly decoupled from GDP growth.\u2019 [171] The report warned: \u2018Without aggressive and sustained mitigation policies being implemented, transport emissions could increase at a faster rate than emissions from the other energy end\u2010use sector and reach around 2014, http://report.mitigation2014.org/drafts/final - draft postplenary/ipcc _ wg3 _ ar5 _ final - draft _ postplenary _ chapter8.pdf 171 Ibid. 43 12 Gt CO2eq/yr by 2050.\u2019 [172] The report recommended: \u2018Avoided journeys and modal shifts due to behavioural change, uptake of improved vehicle and engine performance technologies, low\u2010carbon fuels, investments in related infrastructure, and changes in the built environment, together offer high mitigation potential (high confidence).\u2019 [173] Amongst other things, the report considered the use of electric vehicles. President Barack Obama has been keen to make electric cars more affordable and accessible to the American public. [174] In his 2011 State of the Union address, he observed: \u2018With more research and incentives, we can break our dependence on oil with biofuels, and become the first country to have a million electric vehicles on the road by 2015.\u2019 [175] He has sought to encourage United States innovators and entrepreneurs in the field of clean technology. Tesla has been supported by the United States Government through a US. Energy Department Vehicle Loan. Tesla was able to repay the loan to the government in 2013.
