These benefits make it easier to manage and deploy applications.\\n\\n## Features of Docker\\n\\nDocker comes with powerful features that helps in application development and\\ndevelopment. The following are key features of docker:\\n\\n  * Docker reduces the size of development by providing a smaller part of the OS via containers. \\n  * It is easier to work on the same project by different teams with the help of Containers. \\n  * Docker containers can be deployed anywhere, on any physical, or virtual machines and on the cloud. \\n  * Docker containers are lightweight so, it becomes easy to scale them. \\n  * You can also do fast rebooting in docker container by quickly starting and restarting containers without rebooting the whole system.\\n\\n## Advantages of Docker\\n\\nDocker containers are widely used by developers for building,testing and\\nshipping applications faster across any platform. Apart from this there are so\\nmany other benefits provided by Docker. The following are the advantages of\\ndocker:\\n\\n  * Your application will work same on any system whether you are using any laptop, server or any cloud(AWS,GCP,Azure).\\n  * In docker each application will run on it's own space, so it won't hamper another application work.\\n  * Docker containers start quickly, so your app runs in no tme.\\n  * You can test new features without changing your main application\\n  * Docker uses less memory and power than virtual machines\\n  * You ca easily add more containers if more people use your application.\\n  * Docker works well into development tools and automation setup.\\n\\n## Disadvantages of Docker\\n\\nAs we already discuss about the advantages of docker it's time to discuss\\nabout some disadvantages of docker also. The following are some problems which\\nyou will face while using the docker:\\n\\n  * Complexity will increase due to layering. \\n  * It is difficult to manage a large number of containers. \\n  * For an application that needs better graphics, Docker is not suitable for it. \\n  * Cross-platform compatibility is not allowed. \\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nDocker is a software development framework that allows you to package and run\\napps inside virtual machines on a server. It's often used to create and test\\napplications before deploying them on a real, physical server. This allows\\norganizations to test and deploy their applications quickly and with minimal\\nresources. Docker also makes it easy to package and update apps on any server,\\nreg\"\n  ],\n  \"count\": 1\n}",
