    "chunk": "Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field, at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre; 66-foot) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails (small sticks) balanced on three stumps. Two players from the batting team, the striker and nonstriker, stand in front of either wicket holding bats, while one player from the fielding team, the bowler, bowls the ball toward the striker's wicket from the opposite end of the pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places with the nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one run for each of these exchanges. Runs are also scored when the ball reaches the boundary of the field or when the ball is bowled illegally. The fielding team aims to prevent runs by dismissing batters (so they are \"out\"). Dismissal can occur in various ways, including being bowled (when the ball hits the striker's wicket and dislodges the bails), and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease line in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings (playing phase) ends and the teams swap roles. Forms of cricket range from traditional Test matches played over five days to the newer Twenty20 format (also known as T20), in which each team bats for a single innings of 20 overs (each \"over\" being a set of 6 fair opportunities for the batting team to score) and the game generally lasts three to four hours. Traditionally, cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket, they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string. The earliest known definite reference to cricket is to it being played in South East England in the mid-16th century. It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire, with the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century. The game's governing body is the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of which are full members who play Test matches. The game's rules, the Laws of Cricket, are maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London. The sport is followed primarily in South Asia, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Southern Africa, and the West Indies. While traditionally, cricket has largely been played by men, Women's cricket has experienced large growth in the 21st century. The most successful side playing international cricket is Australia, which has won eight One Day International trophies, including six World Cups, more than any other country, and has been the top-rated Test side more than any other country.",

It was founded by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh in 1946, and it is based in New Delhi, India.[2][3] DLF has developed residential colonies in Delhi such as Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Krishna Nagar, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony, and Hauz Khas. DLF builds residential, office, and retail properties.[4][5] With the passage of the Delhi Development Act in 1957, the local government assumed control of real estate development and banned private real estate developers from Delhi proper. As a result, DLF began acquiring land at a relatively low cost outside the area controlled by the Delhi Development Authority, in the district of Gurgaon, and in the adjacent state of Haryana. In the mid-1970s, the company started developing their DLF City project at Gurgaon. This included hotels, infrastructure, and special economic zones-related development projects. The company is headed by Rajiv Singh, who is the current chairman of the DLF Group. According to the Forbes listing of richest billionaires in 2023, Kushal Pal Singh, Chairman Emeritus, is the 19th richest man in India with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. The company's $US$2 billion IPO in July 2007 was India's biggest IPO in history.[6] In its first quarter results for the period ending 30 June 2007, the company reported a turnover of \u20b931.2098 billion (US$360 million) and profit after taxes of \u20b915.1548 billion (US$180 million).[7] As of 31 March 2012, the company had 1,380 square feet of leased retail space across the country.[8] In 2013-14, it leased out 3 million sq ft of office space in India.[9][10] History DLF's first residential project was Krishna Nagar in East Delhi, which was completed in 1949. Subsequently, the company developed 21 colonies in Delhi, including Model Town, Rajouri Garden, Punjabi Bagh, South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kailash Colony and Hauz Khas. The passage of Delhi Development Act in 1957 was the first serious challenge to company's growth. The Act meant that the government would assume control of all real estate development activities in the city.[11] As a result, DLF decided to move beyond Delhi and focused on the suburb of Gurgaon in Haryana,[12] which had the potential for development of residential and commercial properties. As DLF started to acquire land under the leadership of Chairman K.P. Singh, Gurgaon embarked on a period of rapid growth.[13] A \u20b958 crore deal was cancelled between DLF and Robert Vadra by IAS officer Ashok Khemka.[14] Sponsorship In 2008, DLF became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League, a newly formed Twenty20 cricket league. DLF paid close to \u20b92 billion (US$23 million) for the five-year sponsorship deal.[15] The deal ended in the 2012 version of the season, wherein it was taken over by Pepsi. Beyond buildings Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and DLF, in a 50:50 joint venture, have completed work on a 16-lane, 10.5 km road network in Gurgaon. This stretch from NH8 Toll Plaza to Sector 55/56 in Gurgaon with six underpasses, one flyover and freeways has improved traffic management in the city.[16] To create this",

The investigation revealed that funds intended for electric vehicle procurement were diverted to purchase a \u20b943 crore luxury apartment in DLF's \"The Camellias\" project in Gurugram.\ue206 **Key Findings:** - **Diversion of Funds:** SEBI traced \u20b942.94 crore from Capbridge Ventures LLP, where both Anmol and Puneet Singh Jaggi are designated partners, to a payment made to DLF. The apartment was initially booked in the name of the promoters' mother, Jasminder Kaur, with a \u20b95 crore advance, which was later refunded and replaced by Capbridge as the final buyer.\ue206 - **Layered Transactions:** The funds originated from Gensol, passed through its vendor Go-Auto and related entities, before reaching DLF. The \u20b95 crore booking advance was sourced from Gensol\u2019s funds via multiple related parties and, once refunded by DLF, rerouted to another related entity\u2014Matrix Gas and Renewables. SEBI stated that these transactions demonstrate layered fund flows to disguise personal asset acquisition using public company funds.\ue206 - **Broader Financial Misconduct:** Gensol borrowed over \u20b9977 crore from institutions like IREDA and PFC for procuring 6,400 electric vehicles but acquired only 4,704, costing \u20b9567.73 crore. Nearly \u20b9262 crore remains unaccounted for, allegedly misappropriated through Go-Auto and channeled to multiple promoter-related entities.\ue206 - **Corporate Governance Failures:** SEBI noted a complete breakdown of corporate governance at Gensol, with promoters using the company\u2019s resources for personal expenses, including purchasing luxury real estate and engaging in speculative trading in Gensol\u2019s own shares via Wellray Solar.\ue206 **Regulatory Actions:** - SEBI has barred Anmol and Puneet Singh Jaggi from acting as directors or key managerial personnel in Gensol and prohibited them, along with Gensol, from trading in the securities market.\ue206 - A planned 1:10 stock split has been frozen to protect investors.\ue206 - A forensic audit has been ordered to examine financial records of Gensol and its related entities.\ue206 - SEBI also cited misleading disclosures by Gensol, including exaggerated claims of EV orders and strategic tie-ups, none of which were backed by binding contracts or financial rationale.\ue206 SEBI has warned retail investors to exercise caution, especially in light of the potential for promoters to offload remaining stakes and erode value further.\ue206 --- For the full article and more detailed information, you can visit the original source: \ue200link\ue202turn0search0\ue201.",

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. [1] The company notes that \u2018the commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers\u2019 range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles\u2019. [2] Tesla Motors makes much of its inventive labour force: \u2018Our roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and 1 Tesla Motors, \u2018Annual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012\u2019, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 2 Ibid. 2 software engineering\u2019. [3] The company observes: \u2018We believe these capabilities, coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong in-house engineering and manufacturing capacity, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the Tesla Roadster and Model S.\u2019 [4] The chief executive officer and product architect of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk has established a reputation for being an innovative entrepreneur, across a range of technological fields, including information technology, clean technology, electric cars, and spacecraft. His Tesla Motors\u2019 biography gives a sense of this diverse array of interests: At Tesla, Elon has overseen product development and design from the beginning, including the all electric Tesla Roadster, Model S and Model X. Transitioning to a sustainable energy economy, in which electric vehicles play a pivotal role, has been one of his central interests for almost two decades, stemming from his time as a physics student working on ultracapacitors in Silicon Valley.

In 2012, the company observed: \u2018Our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties.\u2019 [8] Tesla Motors warned: Any failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology.

In its annual report for 2012, the company explains its intellectual property portfolio in respect of its technology: Our battery pack and electric powertrain system has enabled us to deliver market-leading range capability on our vehicles at what we believe is a compelling battery cost per kilowatt-hour. Our battery packs use commercially available lithium-ion battery cells and contain two to three times the energy of any other commercially available electric vehicle battery pack, thereby significantly increasing the range capabilities of our vehicles. Designing an electric powertrain and a vehicle to exploit its energy efficiency has required extensive safety testing and innovation in battery packs, motors, powertrain systems and vehicle engineering. Our proprietary technology includes cooling systems, safety systems, charge balancing systems, battery engineering for vibration and environmental durability, customized motor design and the software and electronics management systems necessary to manage battery and vehicle 8 performance under demanding real-life driving conditions. These technology innovations have resulted in an extensive intellectual property portfolio\u2014as of December 31, 2012, we had 117 issued patents and more than 258 pending patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and internationally in a broad range of areas. [ 22] The company stressed: \u2018Our design and vehicle engineering capabilities, combined with the technical advancements of our powertrain system, have enabled us to design and develop zero tailpipe emission vehicles that we believe overcome the design, styling, and performance issues that we believe have historically limited broad consumer adoption of electric vehicles\u2019. [23] Tesla Motors insisted that its comparative advantages included long range and recharging flexibility; energy efficiency and cost of ownership; and high performance without compromised design or functionality. Assessing its intellectual property portfolio, Tesla Motors stressed in 2012: Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. As of December 31, 2012, we had 117 issued patents and more than 258 pending patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and internationally in a broad range of areas. Our issued patents start expiring in 2026. We intend to continue to file additional patent applications with respect to our technology. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to 22 Tesla Motors, \u2018Annual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012\u2019, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 23 Ibid. 9 narrow our claims.

Tesla also owns 20 patents related to electric motor and drive control, 10 patents on vehicle frames and chassis, followed by a handful of patents related to doors/latches, air conditioning technology, sunroofs (note the signature panoramic roofs of the Model S), and user interfaces/displays. [26] Shah notes the competition in the area: \u2018However, while Tesla may not have much competition in the commercial marketplace for purely electric vehicles, automotive giants such as General Motors, Toyota, Honda, Ford, Nissan, and Daimler have all amassed significant patent portfolios related to electric vehicle technology.\u2019 [27] 24 Ibid. 25 Maulin Shah, \u2018Auto Industry May Ignore Tesla\u2019s Patents\u2019, Enivsion IP, 26 June 2014, http://envisionip.com/blog/2014/06/26/auto - industry - may - ignore - tesla - patents/ 26 Ibid. 27 Ibid. 10 **Image:** [Image: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf-10-0.png]",

[33] The company was also conscious: \u2018In addition, patents issued to us may be infringed upon or designed around by others and others may obtain patents that we need to license or design around, either of which would increase costs and may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\u2019 [34] Such reservations are an important context for the announcement in 2014. In his blog post in 2014, Elon Musk of Tesla Motors discussed his growing disenchantment with the patent system: When I started out with my first company, Zip2, I thought patents were a good thing and worked hard to obtain them. And maybe they were good long ago, but too often these days they serve merely to stifle progress, entrench the positions of giant corporations and enrich those in the legal profession, rather than the actual inventors. After Zip2, when I realized that receiving a patent really just meant that you bought a lottery ticket to a lawsuit, I avoided them whenever possible.

Elon Musk noted that Tesla Motors, at first, sought to build a significant patent portfolio: \u2018At Tesla, however, we felt compelled to create patents out of concern that the big car companies would copy our technology and then use their massive manufacturing, sales and marketing power to overwhelm Tesla\u2019. [36] The company developed a significant portfolio of patents in respect of electric cars and associated infrastructure. Elon Musk observed, though, that such an assumption was incorrect: \u2018The unfortunate reality is the opposite: electric car programs (or programs for any vehicle that doesn\u2019t burn hydrocarbons) at the major manufacturers are small to non-existent, constituting an average of far less than 1% of their total vehicle sales.\u2019 [37] He lamented: \u2018At best, the large automakers are producing electric cars with limited range in limited volume\u2019. [38] Musk observed that some automobile manufacturers produced \u2018no zero emission cars at all\u2019. [39] Tesla Motors has been involved in a number of legal skirmishes in respect of intellectual property. In a 2013 dispute, Tesla Motors was involved in a skirmish with pointSET.

This system essentially allows owner to pre-cool or pre-heat the cabin of a plugged-in Model S. Of course, this is a feature that we\u2019re sure all Model S owners use on almost a daily basis. However, there may be an issue that could prevent Model S owners from accessing this feature in the future. It seems Tesla\u2019s remote access system may infringe upon a patent held by pointSET. [41] On the 30th April 2013, an attorney for pointSET sent a letter to Tesla Motors, alleging that \u2018Tesla induces infringement of claim 6 of United States Patent No. 7,379,541.\u2019 [42] The patent concerned a \u2018method and apparatus for setting programmable features of a motor vehicle.\u2019 43 The letter stated that \u2018pointSET is offering a one-time, fully-paid licensing flat fee of $500,000' that \u2018will cover both past and future use of the technology.\u2019 [44] In response, Tesla Motors sought a declaratory judgment of patent non-infringement in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.

In my 2011 book *Intellectual Property and Climate* *Change: Inventing Clean Technologies,* I considered the significant patent litigation in respect of green cars and transportation. [51] There was an epic dispute between Paice LLC and Toyota Motors over patents regarding hybrid cars, such as the Toyota Prius. Toyota Motors was indignant at the litigation, calling its opponent a \u2018patent shark\u2019. However, the company fared poorly in the long-winded litigation. This conflict was eventually settled, with Toyota Motors paying royalties to Paice LLC. The dispute highlighted that there are major patent thickets surrounding green cars and green transportation.

Lane observed: \u2018So the Tesla-Patent Commons is very significant, and unlike any prior (small \u201ce\u201d) eco-patent commons, but the commercial and legal realities of dealing with patents and positioning technological businesses to be free to operate are always extremely complex.\u2019 [81] He commented upon the gambit by Tesla Motors: \u2018Ultimately, the impact of Musk\u2019s decision may turn on to what extent other such players will be motivated to invest in manufacturing vehicles, batteries, etc. using Tesla\u2019s patented and patent-pending technology with the obvious upside being the proven innovation that technology brings and the down side being no exclusivity, instead of investing in their own R&D and patent protection where the upside may be exclusivity and the down side may be inferior or unproven technologies.\u2019 [82] Don Tapscott and Anthony Williams have argued for the use of open source strategies in respect of clean technologies.

[83] The pair recognised: \u2018It is quickly becoming clear that climate change will be the biggest issue that human civilisation has ever had to deal with.\u2019 [84] Tapscott and Williams were concerned about the limitations of existing responses to the problem of climate change. The writers promoted open and collaborative responses to climate change: \u2018Tackling climate change will not only require unprecedented transformations in our systems of commerce and industry, it will also require fundamental changes to our way of life.\u2019 [85] The pair concluded: \u2018We need to take the sum of mankind\u2019s knowledge about sustainable technologies and industries, and share it for the sake of the planet and the future generations that will inhabit it.\u2019 [86] Similarly, the futurist Jeremy Rifkin considers the rise of collaborative commons in his recent book, *The Zero Marginal Cost Society.* *[87]* He has observed that \u2018a powerful new technology revolution is emerging that is going to fundamentally alter our economic life.\u2019 [88] Rifkin predicts: \u2018The plummeting of marginal costs is spawning a hybrid economy \u2014 part capitalist market and part Collaborative Commons \u2014 with far reaching implications for society.\u2019 [89] Rifkin envisages: \u2018Millions of people are already transferring parts of their economic lives to 83 Don Tapscott, and Anthony Williams, *MacroWikinomics: New Solutions for a Connected Planet*, London: Atlantic Books, 2010. 84 Ibid. 85 Ibid. 86 Ibid. 87 Jeremy Rifkin, *The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of things, The Collaborative Commons,* *and the Eclipse of Capitalism*, New York: Palgrave McMillan, 2014. 88 Ibid. 89 Ibid. 24 the global Collaborative Commons.\u2019 [90] He observes: \u2018Prosumers are plugging into the fledgling Internet of Things (IoT) and making and sharing their own information, entertainment, green energy, and 3D-printed products at near zero marginal cost.\u2019 [91] Rifkin\u2019s thesis is that monopoly capitalism will be displayed by a collaborative commons. [92] He contends that the car is a particularly acute metaphor for the transformation from ownership to access. Rifkin observes: \u2018If ever proof were needed that the capitalist era, wedded to the exchange of property in markets, is ceding ground to the access of services in the Collaborative Commons, the changing relationship to the automobile is prima facie evidence of the great transformation at hand.\u2019 [93] 90 Ibid. 91 Ibid. 92 Ibid, 226-231. 93 Ibid., 231. 25",

[100] He was enthusiastic about the rise of Tesla Motors, and its rapid growth in the automobile marketplace: Tesla fashions itself a Silicon Valley computer company, closer in spirit and thinking to Apple and Google than to its Detroit forebears. Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s CEO, did not deny the possibility of his own company being acquired by a \u201cdeep pockets\u201d company like Apple. Prizes are one thing, but when the rubber hits the proverbial road, unit sales are what matter in the auto industry. When market figures for the second quarter of 2013 were released, Tesla had outsold Mercedes Benz, BMW, and Audi in the \u201clarge luxury\u201d category, according to Green Car reports. [101] Seba maintained that \u2018the electric vehicle will disrupt the gasoline car industry (and with it",

He noted that the electric motor is more energy efficient; the electric vehicle is cheaper to charge; and it is cheaper to maintain. Seba noted that the electric vehicle will disrupt the gasoline car aftermarket. He wondered about the potential for wireless charging. 100 Tony Seba, *Clean Disruption of Energy and Transportation: How Silicon Valley will Make Oil,* *Nuclear, Natural Gas, Coal, Electric Vehicles and Conventional Cars Obsolete by 2030*, Silicon Valley, Clean Planet Ventures, 2014. 101 Ibid., 102. 102 Ibid., 103. 103 Ibid., 104. 28 Seba was impressed by the modular design architecture of electric vehicles. He has also emphasized the combination of big data and fast product development: The difference between the value of Tesla\u2019s electric miles and GM\u2019s gasoline miles has to do with data. Think of an electric vehicle as a mobile computer. Electric Vehicles generate vast amounts of data. A car company sifting through this data can learn and adapt far more quickly than a company without user data. A car company that collects data about its cars can understand customer usage patterns and technology stresses and failures. It can quickly fix mistakes, download new software to the cars, and develop new products and services. The electric vehicle product development process is shortened; it resembles the computer industry\u2019s ultra-fast development cycles. Tesla and the other electric vehicle companies will be on a product development cycle at the exponential speeds of Moore\u2019s Law; Detroit will be on conventional linear speeds. [104] Seba also makes the point that solar and electric vehicles are more land efficient. Moreover, electric vehicles can contribute to grid storage and other services. Seba concludes that the \u2018electric vehicle changes the basis of competition in the transportation industry.\u2019 [105] He predicts that \u2018neither the high-end or low-end gasoline car stands a chance against electric vehicles once electric vehicles are in the same price range.\u2019 [106] Seba also makes the interesting argument that electric cars will be enhanced by technology convergence in respect of clean technologies. He commented: \u2018In the clean energy field, the disruptors (solar, electric vehicles, and autonomous cars), complement and accelerate one another\u2019s adoption\u2019.

As Li-on batteries become cheaper, they can increasingly be used \u2013 and economically be used \u2013 for solar and wind energy storage. The increased demand from solar and wind increases the scale of existing Li-on providers, which in turn pushes down the cost of electric vehicles, solar, and wind. The increasing demand for electric vehicles and solar will attract even more investment in these technologies. Innovative companies that can invent new ways to push costs down and push quality up will thrive. This virtuous cycle of increasing demand, increasing investment, and increasing innovation will dramatically lower costs; it will exponentially improve the quality benefits to both the clean energy and clean transportation industries; it will also lead to a convergence in which batteries can be used for transportation and grid storage. Electric vehicles can be charged at work and become a source as well as a user of energy for the home. The result will be a swift transition from liquid-energy transportation to electric transportation. [109] Seba admits that \u2018an electric vehicle is still more expensive to purchase upfront, mainly due to battery costs\u2019. [110] He predicts that \u2018like other technology products, the technology cost curve of electric vehicles points to a disruption soon; innovative business models will only accelerate the transition from gasoline to electric vehicles.\u2019 [111] It is certainly notable that Elon Musk has investments in both electric cars and solar energy.

[152] Professor Eric Lane from Thomas Jefferson School of Law has been following the longstanding conflict, and has provided a useful summary of the dispute: As it sought to expand into the Chinese market, the electric car maker encountered a businessman named Zhan Baosheng who owned registrations for the TESLA (or \u201cTe Si La\u201d transliterated) trademark in China in both English and Chinese. Zhan\u2019s trademark rights initially blocked Tesla from using the mark there, in early 2014 the company announced that **it had resolved the** **matter** though a court decision granting it the right to use the TESLA mark in China.

He... demanded that Tesla stop all sales and marketing activities in China, shut down showrooms and charging facilities, and pay him 23.9 million yuan ($3.85 million) in compensation. It appears that Zhan finally got his pay day. Tesla recently said it resolved the dispute \u2013 this time via a direct settlement with Zhan rather than relying on the Chinese court system. [153] In August 2014, Tesla Motors finally reached a settlement to end the China trademark dispute. There appeared to be a settlement, in return for the ownership of the trademarks, and the website names registered in China, such as tesla.cn and teslamotors.cn. [154] The company observed \u2018Mr. Zhan has agreed to have the Chinese authorities complete the process of cancelling the Tesla trademarks that he had registered or applied for, at no cost to Tesla.\u2019 [155] The company noted: \u2018Collectively, these actions remove any doubt with respect to Tesla\u2019s undisputed rights to its trademarks in China.\u2019 [156] Tesla Motors declined to discuss the financial settlement in respect of the transfer of the ownership of the domain names.

On the 14th June 2014, President Barack Obama gave a commencement address to the University of California, Irvine. He told his audience: We need scientists to design new fuels. We need farmers to help grow them. We need engineers to invent new technologies. We need entrepreneurs to sell those technologies. We need workers to operate assembly lines that hum with high-tech, zero-carbon components. We need builders to hammer into place the foundations for a clean energy age. We need diplomats and businessmen and women, and Peace Corps volunteers to help developing nations skip past the dirty phase of development and transition to sustainable sources of energy.

In cooperation with strategic battery manufacturing partners, we\u2019re planning to build a large scale factory that will allow us to achieve economies of scale and minimize costs through innovative manufacturing, reduction of logistics waste, optimization of co-located processes and reduced overhead. The Gigafactory is designed to reduce cell costs much faster than the status quo and, by 2020, produce more lithium ion batteries annually than were produced worldwide in 2013. By the end of the first year of volume production of our mass market vehicle, we expect the Gigafactory will have driven down the per kWh cost of our battery pack by more than 30 percent.

What we are trying to address is not the lay of the land today, where there are indeed too many suppliers, most of whom are producing relatively low photonic efficiency solar cells at uncompelling costs, but how we see the future developing. Without decisive action to lay the groundwork today, the massive volume of affordable, high efficiency panels needed for unsubsidized solar power to outcompete fossil fuel grid power simply will not be there when it is needed. SolarCity was founded to accelerate mass adoption of sustainable energy. The sun, that highly convenient and free fusion reactor in the sky, radiates more energy to the Earth in a few hours than the entire human population consumes from all sources in a year. This means that solar panels, paired with batteries to enable power at night, can produce several orders of magnitude more electricity than is consumed by the entirety of human civilization. A cogent assessment of sustainable energy potential from various sources is described well in this Sandia paper:www.sandia.gov/~jytsao/Solar%20FAQs.pdf. Even if the solar industry were only to generate 40 percent of the world\u2019s electricity with photovoltaics by 2040, that would mean installing more than 400 GW of solar capacity per year for the next 25 years. We absolutely believe that solar power can and will become the world\u2019s predominant source of energy within our lifetimes, but there are obviously a **lot** of panels that have to be manufactured and installed in order for that to happen.

[197] In his book on *Sustainable Energy Solutions for Climate Change*, Mark Diesendorf highlights the significance of solar photovoltaics. [198] He emphasized: \u2018PV\u2019s low and decreasing prices, huge resource, low environmental and health impacts, low land use compared with agriculture and widely available materials (at least for silicon crystal technologies) gives confidence that, with geographic diversity of collectors, it can make a substantial contribution to future electricity demand.\u2019 [199] In his essay, \u2018The New Turning Point\u2019, Al Gore has emphasized that the key question in addressing climate change is how \u2018quickly we can accelerate and complete the transition to a low-carbon civilization\u2019. [200] He has been particularly enthusiastic about solar photovoltaics: There is surprising \u2013 even shocking \u2013 good news: Our ability to convert sunshine into usable energy has become much cheaper far more rapidly than anyone had predicted.
